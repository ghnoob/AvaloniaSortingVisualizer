Ask and you shall receive: A GM SoundFont by me, stgiga, of those musical
calculators that was turned into an incomplete and non-GM SoundFont by
evnchn on Github, but now including a drumkit (the Controller Click from
Marcel J. Therrien's Gamer's Orchestra to represent calculator keypresses), and
SFX (Pencil from JS121's SFX, to fit the math theme.) sleaf (maker of the old
DSoundFont Ultimate and its much better successors Enchant! and ETERNAL!)
helped fix the balance, which I did additional work to fix. The structure of
the bank owes its origins to Cirnomiji/Pezbeth/CB007. Credit goes to him. That
structure is what my 6868.sf2 is based on. Many thanks!

Enjoy this mathematical SoundFont from someone better at writing than math!
Stay safe, stay home, and wash ur hands!
